# codingbat-swift
print(“Hello World!”)

I uploaded all my solutions for the problems from codingbat.com (done in Swift 3).
I uploaded every section two times. First try to solve it by your own,
if you get “true” for every statement, you have done a good job :)

Have fun with swift :)
And feel free to commit your answer, if it is more efficient ✌️😊
