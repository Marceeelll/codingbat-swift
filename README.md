Have fun with swift :)
And feel free to commit your answer, if it is more efficient ‚úåÔ∏èüòä


# How to use this Repository?
First have a look to the folder "You Solutions".
There you find all the playground files for Xcode, where you can try to program your own solution.

If you open the playground for the first time, you probably see something like this:
